            <h2>OUR PURPOSE</h2> <br>

            <h4>The Inventors Council of Central Florida was formed in the 1950’s and has been continuously running since 1974 to provide an educational, not-for-profit community service organization to encourage creative people of all ages to develop their
                innovative skills and help them protect their ideas by learning how to use the government patent, trademark, and copyright registration systems.<br><br> Inventing is only the beginning of the story. Once an idea has been created it is
                fairly useless until it gets to the marketplace. We help here too by providing resources to help you understand and connect with marketing, financing, production and sales. We do not do the work for you. That is your job. But we can help
                you get going in the right direction.<br><br> In December of 2017 we officially became a Florida corporation, Inventors Council of Central Florida, Inc.
                <br><br> In October of 2018 we became a federal 501 (c)(3) charitable organization making your donations tax deductible.
                <br><br> We are inventors helping inventors. Members have access to many contacts and services that help to bring their creations to reality. At this point all work done by anyone in this organization is strictly voluntary.

                            <p>When I had my "big idea" I had no concept of how to make it into reality. After finding the Inventors Council I learned about the patent process, prototyping, sourcing, and marketing. Most of these I had approached all wrong.
                                After spending thousands of dollars I discovered I had an invention that, while good, interesting, and it worked, it would not be possible to make money. With what I learned from ICCF I am now taking a more sensible approach
                                to new concepts. I am determining if I can make money on a project before I spend too much. </p>

                            <p>I've been a successful entrepreneur and inventor/designer at 58 and starting at the age of 13. I had the privilege to meet some local Inventors at the March ICCF meeting this past Saturday. There were several first timers like
                                myself at this meeting. The atmosphere was friendly, open and informative. My project was shared with everyone and the input was very useful. A personal goal is to learn something new every day and in this meeting I can
                                take the rest of the week off! I've made some new friends and feel confident that we can help each other with our experiences and knowledge of production, manufacturing, how patents work and guidance in getting product
                                to market. A special thanks to Dave and Ian for keeping these meetings going on since 1974!</p>

                            <p>I must admit that I had no idea what to expect when I joined the Inventors Council of Central Florida.  You hear horror stories of how peoples' ideas, and or inventions, being ripped off by the very organization(s) advertising
                                    to assist in making your idea or creation into a full fledged money making invention. I personally did my own research on a couple of these well advertised companies. With overwhelming negative testimonials and pending
                                    lawsuits against them, I vowed to stay away from such groups. However, having what I believe to be a viable invention and not really knowing where to turn, I read a book for inventors. The author suggested finding a local
                                    inventor 's group for help.  Well, I did and am I ever so happy for doing so!
                                
                                The ICCF is an awesome inventor's group. It is administered by some honest, highly experienced, and down to earth people. I love the unpretentious atmosphere and how organized the meetings are. The moderators and some
                                    members can answer any and all questions regarding inventing whether it be patenting, marketing, financing, etc. They have helped me tremendously with my SAC & SAM inventions and the launching of Peter Love Creations LLC.
                                    Even though I am in the beginning stages, I know I am headed in the right direction. Thank you very much Inventors Council of Central Florida. </p>
