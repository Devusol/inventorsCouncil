      <h2>OUR PURPOSE</h2> <br>

      <h4>The Inventors Council of Central Florida was formed in the 1950’s and has been continuously running since 1974
        to provide an educational, not-for-profit community service organization to encourage creative people of all
        ages
        to develop their innovative skills and help them protect their ideas by learning how to use the government
        patent,
        trademark, and copyright registration systems.<br><br>

        Inventing is only the beginning of the story. Once an idea has been created it is fairly useless until it gets
        to
        the marketplace. We help here too by providing resources to help you understand and connect with marketing,
        financing, production and sales. We do not do the work for you. That is your job. But we can help you get going
        in
        the right direction.<br><br>

        In December of 2017 we officially became a Florida corporation, Inventors Council of Central Florida,
        Inc.<br><br>

        In October of 2018 we became a federal 501 (c)(3) charitable organization making your donations tax deductible.
        <br><br>

        We are inventors helping inventors. Members have access to many contacts and services that help to bring their
        creations to reality. At this point all work done by anyone in this organization is strictly voluntary.
