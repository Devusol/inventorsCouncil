            <h2>OUR PURPOSE</h2> <br>

            <h4>The Inventors Council of Central Florida was formed in the 1950â€™s and has been continuously running
                since 1974 to provide an educational, not-for-profit community service organization to encourage
                creative people of all ages to develop their
                innovative skills and help them protect their ideas by learning how to use the government patent,
                trademark, and copyright registration systems.<br><br> Inventing is only the beginning of the story.
                Once an idea has been created it is
                fairly useless until it gets to the marketplace. We help here too by providing resources to help you
                understand and connect with marketing, financing, production and sales. We do not do the work for you.
                That is your job. But we can help
                you get going in the right direction.<br><br> In December of 2017 we officially became a Florida
                corporation, Inventors Council of Central Florida, Inc.
                <br><br> In October of 2018 we became a federal 501 (c)(3) charitable organization making your donations
                tax deductible.
                <br><br> We are inventors helping inventors. Members have access to many contacts and services that help
                to bring their creations to reality. At this point all work done by anyone in this organization is
                strictly voluntary.

                            <p>When I had my "big idea" I had no concept of how to make it into reality. After finding
                                the Inventors Council I learned about the patent process, prototyping, sourcing, and
                                marketing. Most of these I had approached all wrong.
                                After spending thousands of dollars I discovered I had an invention that, while good,
                                interesting, and it worked, it would not be possible to make money. With what I learned
                                from ICCF I am now taking a more sensible approach
                                to new concepts. I am determining if I can make money on a project before I spend too
                                much. </p>

                            <p>I've been a successful entrepreneur and inventor/designer at 58 and starting at the age
                                of 13. I had the privilege to meet some local Inventors at the March ICCF meeting this
                                past Saturday. There were several first timers like
                                myself at this meeting. The atmosphere was friendly, open and informative. My project
                                was shared with everyone and the input was very useful. A personal goal is to learn
                                something new every day and in this meeting I can
                                take the rest of the week off! I've made some new friends and feel confident that we can
                                help each other with our experiences and knowledge of production, manufacturing, how
                                patents work and guidance in getting product
                                to market. A special thanks to Dave and Ian for keeping these meetings going on since
                                1974!</p>

                            <p>
                            <h6 style="font-weight: normal;">I must admit that I had no idea what to expect when I
                                joined the Inventors Council of Central Florida. You hear horror stories of how peoples'
                                ideas, and or inventions, being ripped off by the very organization(s) advertising
                                to assist in making your idea or creation into a full fledged money making invention. I
                                personally did my own research on a couple of these well advertised companies. With
                                overwhelming negative testimonials and pending
                                lawsuits against them, I vowed to stay away from such groups. However, having what I
                                believe to be a viable invention and not really knowing where to turn, I read a book for
                                inventors. The author suggested finding a
                                local inventor 's group for help. Well, I did and am I ever so happy for doing so! The
                                ICCF is an awesome inventor's group. It is administered by some honest, highly
                                experienced, and down to earth people. I love the
                                unpretentious atmosphere and how organized the meetings are. The moderators and some
                                members can answer any and all questions regarding inventing whether it be patenting,
                                marketing, financing, etc. They have helped
                                me tremendously with my SAC & SAM inventions and the launching of Peter Love Creations
                                LLC. Even though I am in the beginning stages, I know I am headed in the right
                                direction. Thank you very much Inventors Council
                                of Central Florida.
